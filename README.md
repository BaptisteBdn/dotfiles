# Dotfiles

My dotfile repository containing everything needed for my i3 setup : i3-gaps, rounded corners and pywal themes ! I am currently using EndeavourOS (arch based) but it should work on other distro with minor modifications.

## Usage & Installation

For an easy way to install and use those dotfile, please check [ansible-dotfiles](https://github.com/BaptisteBdn/ansible-dotfiles).

## Notes
- Wallpapers can be found in `.config/wallpaper`.
- Font is DejaVuSans
- Original resolution is 1440p but it should work with other resolutions (screenshots are 1080p)
- I tweaked some generated pywal schemes in order to have better results, in order to keep those changes I added the `.cache/wal/schemes` folder.
- This design is inspired by [k-vernooy](https://github.com/k-vernooy/dotfiles).
